# Command line Based Machine Learning Preprocessing Tool
## Objective
 Implementing a Command Line Interface (CLI) which will preprocess your dataset and save your time.
 
## Overview
Machine Learning is a subset of the larger field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on teaching computers how to learn without the need to be programmed for specific tasks. In fact, the key idea behind ML is that it is possible to create algorithms that learn from and make predictions on the data.


Examples of Machine Learning are present everywhere including the spam filter that flags messages in your email, the recommendation engine Netflix uses to suggest content you might like, and the self-driving cars being developed by Google and other companies.


But before applying Machine Learning on any dataset, you need to convert it in such a way that the algorithms could understand the dataset. These steps are preprocessing steps.




Data preprocessing is an integral step in Machine Learning as the quality of data and the useful information that can be derived from it directly affects the ability of your model to learn; therefore, it is extremely crucial that you preprocess your data before feeding it into your model.

One more advantage of preprocessing is that it is considered time consuming for many machine learning developers. This simple CLI tool will save your time so that you can utilize it in applying different machine learning algorithms.


You will apply the following preprocessing steps:

Handling NULL values
Encoding Categorical Data
Feature Scaling



Finally, you will also be able to download your preprocessed dataset.
